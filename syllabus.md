# TIY Charleston Front End Engineering Syllabus

Welcome to The Iron Yard and to the Front End engineering course. It's going to be a very challenging 12 weeks and I'm happy you've all decided to take on this challenge.

- Reviews with the TA will take place Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4 p.m. - ? (2+ hrs)
- #IronPints Friday at 4.00pm at our local bars.

**Communication**

If you are sick, running late, have to take care of a car, etc... ping your instructor directly and as early as possible. Failing to do so will only hurt your progress in this class.

Also, you need to ask questions. If you aren't, you either aren't involved/paying attention or you aren't understanding enough to ask a question. :-) Asking questions is a muscle, and you need to exercise that muscle! Even someone participates with "just a question", it benefits the classroom. Great learners ask great questions â€“ never forget that!

- #IronPints Friday at 3.30pm at our local bars.

**Office hours and one-on-one instruction**

A teacher or TA will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in Slack, which we use for group communication.

**Holidays**

**Materials**
All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. We recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM.

Your MacBook must be running [OSX El Capitan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

Accounts to sign up for:

If you don't have an account with any of these, sign up for them now:

1. http://codepen.io
2. http://github.com
3. http://medium.com
4. http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/)) and a chat program([Slack](https://slack.com/)), but they will all be free and/or open-source.

A custom [install script](https://github.com/TIY-Charleston-Front-End-Engineering/Course-Guide/blob/master/Resources/system-resources/ultimate-install-script.sh) will be provided and run the first day of class. This script will install the necessary tools onto your Mac and also modify some of the settings to optimize the machine for programming, battery life, and other improved features.

**Policies**

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the day of its deadline. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code will not only render your homework unacceptable but will also prevent you from learning the material (and often from writing code that works). Copying homework can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally speaking, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Have an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, as we genuinely care for the well-being of our students.**
