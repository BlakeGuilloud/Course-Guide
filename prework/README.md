# Prework

Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.

## Before enrollment

  1. Work through the JavaScript track on CodeAcademy: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript. Go as far as you need in order to complete the task in (2), below.

  2. Attempt the 23-question assessment here: http://tinyurl.com/jdfrdaa. You don't need to get every question right; you don't even need to *attempt* every question. Once you've completed as many as you can, send your (numbered) responses to the front-end javascript instructor. His email is travis.hubbard@theironyard.com.

  A few notes on the coding environment linked in the above url:

  - Use the `log` function to write output to the right-hand pane. For example, try typing `log('hello world')` in the left-hand pane. You'll make heavy use of those `log` statements to debug and inspect variables.
  - With every keystroke you make in the left-hand pane, all the code in that region will be re-evaluated, and all output will be shown on the right.


## After enrollment

  1. Check the software and accounts you will need in the [materials section of the syllabus](https://github.com/TIY-Houston-Front-End-Engineering/Course-Guide/blob/master/Resources/syllabus.md).

    If you don't have an account with any of these, sign up for them now:

      - http://codepen.io
      - http://github.com
      - http://medium.com
      - http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

    There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and a chat program, but they will all be free and/or open-source.

  2. Start these and finish (as much as humanly possible):

    1. Learn some basic HTML and CSS (estimated time, 15 hrs)

        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website
        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics

    2. Continue learning JavaScript (estimated time, 10 hrs)

        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics
        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-loops-arrays-and-objects

    3. Learn Layout + Positioning (estimated time, 2 hrs)
        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-layout-basics        
        - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/responsive-layouts


    4. Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)

        The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. A lot of the tools that are used in developing modern web applications originate from or utilize the command line because it is fast, efficient, and enhances productivity while allowing for maximum configuration.

         We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

        Especially if youâ€™ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.
